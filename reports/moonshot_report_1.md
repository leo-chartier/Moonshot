# Moonshot project report

## Overview

For my project, I decided to go with the topic of music.

My project is about sound recognition. More specifically, it is to create a mobile application. It will help differentiate between different instruments.

For example, my application will help you differentiate between the sounds of a violin and a cello if you do not know the difference between them.

## Current advancement

First of all, like any project, I started by listing and describing the different requirements of the project. Although I am both the client and the developer, this is a way to not go into scope creep.

I also started writing the functional specifications with different personae and what is in or out of scope. There is still work to be done here with, for example, the risks or the law constraints.

Parallelly, I also did some research. Those include:
- Market research
- Competition
- Technical implementation options

On that last point, I realized that doing this project solely with mathematics is near impossible. Thus, I need to use Artificial Intelligence, and multiple research papers do the same.

I have yet to name the project/application, but I do not think this is a pressing matter (correct me if I'm wrong).

## Slow pace

Even though my project was accepted in October, little progress has been made. It can be explained by a few reasons, in order of importance:
- Focus on school projects: When working at home, it mostly is to work on the school projects as their due date is closer
- Motivation: I tend to spend more time on side-projects that I believe will programming-wise bring me more experience
- Time: Even more so now with the school's dev/robotics club and some personal house-work, time is a constraint I have to deal with

From now on, I will try to rework my schedule to focus more on this project to finish it in time.
